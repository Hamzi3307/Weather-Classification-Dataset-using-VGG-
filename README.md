# Image Classification on Weather Dataset using Fine-tuned VGG19

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system designed to classify weather conditions based on images. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically recognize and categorize weather conditions such as sunrise, shiny, cloudy, rainy, and foggy. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and additional information for developers and users.
